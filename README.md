# Wirecloud Current Context Values Widget
This is just a simple widget that i developed to show current context values in a form of dials that can be replaced or in a form of text.  
This widget uses the Widget API from wirecloud, and in order for this API to work you need to connect this widget to NGSI Source using the Wirecloud wiring.
